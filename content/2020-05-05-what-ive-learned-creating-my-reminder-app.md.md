Since March 19th, I've been coding my first app I intend to let others use. It's taken me a little longer than a month which I will attribute to I having to learn something new on every technical layer. I will be releasing it soon, but I have 2 major bugs, 1 additional feature, and some testing to do before I release it to pre-alpha and get some feedback. I've learned a lot about technologies I'm interested in so that has been a huge benefit, but I've learned a few other things. The top three things are:

* tools that noticeably save time will become more valuable.
* I enjoy a task plus goal time management life style,
* feeling free to learn what I want is a enjoyable privlege,

During the COVID-19 lockdown, I've increasingly started crafting my schedule around the tasks that are most important to me instead of using an hourly schedule. I don't have a job so that has been mostly a breeze. Whether that time is spent with my son or coding up [Renotify](https://renotify.io/). I like to have a series of tasks that I must complete in a two week period with time markers on when a task should be completed. Often times I complete the quickest tasks at the beginning of the week. Tasks I don't know how long will take to complete are spread throughout the period. Lastly tasks I know will take significant amount of time I break up into smaller tasks and I knock them out in blocks through out the a normal day. The pleasant part is I've started doing healthier things such as working out, eating better and investing more time with my son. I'm more excited about completing on my task list.

Unfortunate problem that have become are obvious include many non priority tasks being missed. I increasingly need to be notified to do them or I delegate it to technology which is one of the reasons I built Renotify. Technology that saves me time has become more valuable because I can spend time doing things I want to do. I save a lot of time telling voice assistants to do tasks for me. I think that increase in saving time should be added to reminder tools. 

I've started enjoying focusing on fewer tasks so much I now budget for tools that I know will actively save me time. For example, asistants and algorithms have made it super easy to save time on physical tasks that take less than 5 minutes: searching for music via Spotify playlists, turning on/off lights, or restarting a show where I last watched. Assistants may have made me use software such as Spotify more often because the ability to search is so easy. Then there are the sub $100 investments that go well with doing those tasks streaming devices,
