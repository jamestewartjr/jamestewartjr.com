Today is Day 2 of Week 7 and I have decided to continue with a blog in order to increase my speed of learning. Two leading reasons I have not continued with a blog has been 1) I use to blog and blogging without structure has always been difficult and 2) I wanted to know how much quicker my learning would increase after engaging in a blog.

I now have a writing structure I want to follow. So 1 is no longer an issue. Plus, seven weeks is definitely a long enough time to determine a speed of learning.

Over the next few months, I will write about topics I have learned and explored. I hope you find these articles more than slightly enjoyable.
