This month I created a new personal website using [Gatsby](www.gatsbyjs.org). I chose Gatsby because it allowed me to use my React skills, have a playground to try different techniques and gave me a simple way to share my thoughts. Over the years, I have written on many platforms- Medium, WordPress, and others. I've recognized that each time I changed platforms I wanted to do more than write. That interest in wanting to communicate information in many different formats has led me to become a blogger, marketer and now an engineer. I hope you the upcoming information at a minimum interesting and at some point useful. Thanks for spending your time exploring this site.
