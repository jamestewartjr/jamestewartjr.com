# Social Links Component Design

## Overview
A standalone React component that displays social media links with icons, designed to be reusable across the application.

## Requirements
- Display social media links with associated icons
- Maintain accessibility standards
- Be responsive and match existing site styling
- Easy to maintain and update
- Typescript support for type safety

## Technical Design

### Component Structure
typescript
interface SocialLink {
friendlyName: string;
link: string;
icon: string;
isWebmention?: boolean;
}
type SocialLinksProps = {
className?: string;
}


### Icon Solution
We'll use `react-icons` library as it:
- Is lightweight and tree-shakeable
- Has extensive icon collection
- Works well with Next.js
- Has good TypeScript support

### Implementation Details
1. Create new component at `app/components/social-links.tsx`
2. Social links data will be stored in a separate config file for easy maintenance
3. Component will accept optional className prop for styling flexibility
4. Will use semantic HTML (ul/li) for link list
5. Will include proper aria labels and screen reader support

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS to match existing application styling
- Implement hover states for interactive elements
- Ensure responsive design

### Testing
Create tests to verify:
- Component renders correctly
- Links are properly formatted
- Accessibility requirements are met
