# Google Analytics Integration Design

## Overview
Implement Google Analytics tracking in our Next.js application to gather user behavior insights.

## Phase 1: Basic Page View Tracking
- Create a dedicated GoogleAnalytics component
- Set up environment configuration
- Implement basic page view tracking
- Add privacy-aware loading

### Technical Design
1. Environment Setup:
   - Add GA4 Measurement ID to .env.local
   - Configure types for window.gtag

2. Component Structure:
   ```typescript
   components/
     analytics/
       GoogleAnalytics.tsx    # Main GA component
       types.ts              # Type definitions
       hooks/
         usePageView.ts      # Hook for page view tracking
   ```

3. Implementation Approach:
   - Use next/script for optimal loading
   - Implement as a modular component
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Add basic error handling

## Phase 2: Event Tracking (Future)
- Implement event tracking hooks
- Add specific event tracking for key user actions

## Security & Privacy Considerations
- Store Measurement ID in environment variables (Future)
- Load analytics only after user consent (if required) (Future)
- Respect Do Not Track settings (Future)
- Anonymize IP addresses where required (Future)

## Testing Strategy
- Verify script loading
- Confirm page view tracking
- Test environment variable handling
- Validate data in GA4 dashboard
