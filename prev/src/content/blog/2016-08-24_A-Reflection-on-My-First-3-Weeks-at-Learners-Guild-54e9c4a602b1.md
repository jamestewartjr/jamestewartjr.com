A little over three weeks ago on July 11th I started as a learner at [Learners Guild](https://www.learnersguild.org/). The program takes 10 months to complete so by the end participants are to become front-end web developers. Here’s a look back.

In the first week, I chose a project that made me create a personal portfolio website. From that project, I learned how HTML and CSS worked together by creating it without any frameworks. In terms of challenge, it was an easier project. I chose the project because I wanted to do a project that I really wanted to work on by myself and to become more comfortable with the people and guild.

In the second week, I chose to create [a web app](https://github.com/jamestewartjr/cagey-lapwing) that allowed Learners Guild participants to see potential projects they could work on. That particular project was way too hard and my team barely completed half of it. I attempted to do way more than I thought I could and completely failed. React was much too hard for me to learn in that week. That week I learned how little I knew and slow I actually comprehend hard things. Web development can be really hard. I thought I could learn a lot faster than was possible,

In the third week, I adjusted based on what I learned from the first two weeks. I chose to create a [javascript library](https://github.com/jamestewartjr/js-ruby-speak). I wanted a project that would deepen my understanding of one particular piece of web development and is challenging as well. The library utilizes Ruby function abilities in javascript. Out of the 22 created I completed 5 by myself and 2 shared help and 1 with significant help. I’m very happy about that result because most of the work happened later in the week. Week 3 is also when I learned TDD by using Jasmine. Also, I became aware of ES2015 — a lot fewer semicolons! We even published [the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-ruby-speak)! Others can use it. Here are a few more things that I know I can guide someone else through the process

What is and how to use standard.js?  
How to add and remove dependencies in package.json?
