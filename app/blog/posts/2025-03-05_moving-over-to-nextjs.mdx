## Focusing on What Matters

I recently transitioned my personal website from Astro to Next.js. I made this change to prioritize my focus on AI development and content creation. While Astro has a large and active community, I found I was distracted by the learning. I don't want the platform I use to hinder my learning or the pace at which I create. Next.js allows me to concentrate on building the AI tools and features I envision without having to learn more. I moved the learning curve to other topics.

## Accelerating with AI

AI has significantly accelerated my learning and broadened the range of topics I explore. I don't want to be restricted by my platform as I delve deeper into specific areas. I'm not saying Astro has less features, but I do know I was more focused on that while using it. Quicker communication and workflow are more important to me at this time. I want to prioritize content creation and sharing ideas over learning a new platform.
